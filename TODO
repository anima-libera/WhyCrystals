- Make properties be able to be more than one vertex attribute,
  then fuse the property "spriteid" and "scale"
- Add a flag on sprite ids or something to mirror the sprite along the y axis
- Make a property know whether it is OpenGL-buffer-izable or not

- Make animals move around (a bit like the player can)
  by adding a property that contains the motion data
- Add a shader to display the motion data for debuging

- Add the concept of displayer, which can be a collection of shaders
  that can all be applied all at once on colts

- Make a command line based debugging interface
- Document headers
- Replace assert by a custom ASSERT macro with nice explainations
- Add wrappers around malloc & co. to catch errors and leaks
- Add a tracing system with signal handlers to print the trace stack
- Fill the abreviation table

- Make a practical (and optimized) way to store and apply shaders on single
  objects (such as the player, or the cursor, etc.)
- Add 0-sized properties (aka tag components)

- FIXME: Some trees doesn't z-order properly
- Add a renderer that colors the pixels according to the z value

- Add one chunk of a grid of tiles
- Add types of tiles
- Add water
- Lower the level of water
- Draw a dirt wall to fill the space between a water tile and the tile y+1
- Make multiple chunks (do NOT try to optimize anything yet)

- Add bullets
- Make the player shoot in a precise direction via the mouse
- Make bullets kill animals

- Add turrets
- Make turrets shoot at animals
- Add a core at the middle
- Make some animals follow a path to the core
- Make animals on the path want to break the now breakable core

- Add particles
- Add sounds
- Add UI rendering
- Add text rendering
- Make the world view angle rotatable (like in the last maae attempt)

- Fix all the leaks
- Use glBufferSubData instead of glBufferData when possible
- Optimize smata
- Optimize octa
  - By making the finding of unused lines super fast (like does an allocator)
  - By updating the OpenGL buffers only when necessary and on smaller slices
- Expand the TODO list
