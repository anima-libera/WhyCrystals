- Make the animals be killed by shots
- Add turrets
- Make turrets shoot at animals
- Add a core at the middle
- Make some animals follow a path to the core
- Make animals on the path want to break the now breakable core
- Make the player movable by targetting destination via the mouse
- Make the visual be allocated in free spaces instead of at the darray's end
- Make the visual dynamic array chunk based, or not, think about it
- Animate the player and animals walking (on 2 small shitty sprites)
- Make multiple chunks (do NOT try to optimize anything yet)
- Expand the TODO list
