- Fuse the property "spriteid" and "scale", or not, but think about it
- Add a flag on sprite ids or something to mirror the sprite along the y axis
- Make a property know whether it is OpenGL-buffer-izable or not
- Make a command line based debugging interface
- Document headers
- Replace assert by a custom ASSERT macro with nice explainations
- Add wrappers around malloc & co. to catch errors and leaks
- Fill the abreviation table

- Make a practical (and optimized) way to store and apply shaders on single
  objects (such as the player, or the cursor, etc.)

- FIXME: Some trees doesn't z-order properly
- Add a renderer that colors the pixels according to the z value

- Add one chunk of a grid of tiles
- Add types of tiles
- Add water
- Lower the level of water
- Draw a dirt wall to fill the space between a water tile and the tile y+1
- Make multiple chunks (do NOT try to optimize anything yet)

- Add animals
- Make animals move around (a bit like the player can)

- Add bullets
- Make the player shoot in a precise direction via the mouse
- Make bullets kill animals

- Add turrets
- Make turrets shoot at animals
- Add a core at the middle
- Make some animals follow a path to the core
- Make animals on the path want to break the now breakable core

- Add particles
- Add sounds
- Add UI rendering
- Add text rendering
- Make the world view angle rotatable (like in the last maae attempt)

- Fix all the leaks
- Use glBufferSubData instead of glBufferData when possible
- Optimize smata
- Optimize octa
- Expand the TODO list
