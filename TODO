- TODO
  Instead of useing take and giveback functions that will definitely do shit,
  simply make some macros and use the indices, always,
  this may actually solve all the problems, and doing arithmetic is not
  what makes programs slow...

- TODO
  Think aout (but do not implemet yet) a system that would allow to queue tasks
  related to things such as spawning an animal or a bunch of particles,
  and executes them at some point in the game loop

- TODO
  ACTUALLY JUST IMPLEMENT SOME VARIATION OF AN ECS

- Make sure darrays are not moved while ptrs to cells are still used (dbg mode)
- Add __FILE__, __func__ and __LINE__ support in darray safety features
- Document headers such as da.h
- Replace assert by a custom ASSERT macro with nice explainations
- Organize world.c better
- Fill the abreviation table
- Add turrets
- Make turrets shoot at animals
- Add a core at the middle
- Make some animals follow a path to the core
- Make animals on the path want to break the now breakable core
- Make the player movable by targetting destination via the mouse
- Make the player shoot in a precise direction via the mouse
- Make the visual be allocated in free spaces instead of at the darray's end
- Make the visual dynamic array chunk based, or not, think about it
- Animate the player and animals walking (on 2 small shitty sprites)
- Make multiple chunks (do NOT try to optimize anything yet)
- Add a texture management system
- Make it easy to add new types of objects
- Add particles
- Make the animals not spawn/walk in water or outside of the map
- Lower the level of water
- Draw a dirt wall to fill the space between a water tile and the tile y+1
- Add sounds
- Add wrappers around the allocator functions to catch errors and leaks
- Fix all the leaks
- Use glBufferSubData instead of glBufferData when possible
- Optimize out take and giveback functions for release builds
- Expand the TODO list
